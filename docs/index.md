The Turn Based Shooter Kit is an easy to use template for creating first-person turn-based shooter type of games!
While the kit uses sprite visuals and a shooter setting, the logic can easily be applied to 3D models and a fantasy setting.

Supports PC.  
Tested on Windows and Mac OS.  
Full gamepad support.

The template is created using Blueprints and allows easy customization.
 
The project will be maintained, so feel free to get in touch to suggest changes, features or anything else.

__Features include:__ 

- Different types of enemies, pickups and weapons
- Easy to create and modify enemies using templates and components
- Systems for health, ammo, stats, inventory, leveling, save/load functionality
- Extendible level objects that use interaction like locked doors, secret passages and terminals
- And much more.
